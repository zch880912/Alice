- User flagged for having same address as S. LNAME, a user who defaulted making no payments. 
- User has same apt number, had an issue with her email, declined credit building
- User said they know FNAME LNAME, just like S. LNAME. Address was fillout out exactly the same. 
- Different numbers and prepaid cards were used by SL and DC. 

No one of the flags establish fraudulent intent. In fact, we want to take special care not to deny a person credit because of the credit history of the people they may live with.  DC's delivery was not mailed and AK placed a call and left a message asking for a call back. Message included our need to verify certain security information . 

1/7 
No call or text back from DC. Holding deliveries indefinitely until resolved.
